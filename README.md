## Quick start

### Dependency
Some package dependencies need to be installed before compiling.
#### Debian/Ubuntu
``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential wget git python libc6-i386 
```


#### Windows

Supports compilating in Cygwin, MinGW, WSL2 and more environments

### Get SDK
Make sure to get SDK through git recursion:
``` bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/tuya/tuya-iotos-embeded-sdk-wifi-ble-bk7231n.git
```
or
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tuya/tuya-iotos-embeded-sdk-wifi-ble-bk7231n.git
$ git submodule update --init
```

### Compile

The compile project is in the apps directory, you can quickly compile, burn, and run the process through `tuya_demo_template`. Use the following command in the root directory to compile: 
``` bash
$ sh build_app.sh apps/tuya_demo_template tuya_demo_template 1.0.0
```
apps/tuya_demo_template: compile project path

tuya_demo_template: compile project name

1.0.0: The version of the current compilation firmware

### Compilation cleanup

You can clear the compiled intermediate files with the following commands:

``` bash
$ sh build_app.sh apps/tuya_demo_template tuya_demo_template 1.0.0 clean
```

### Burning authorization
